**Overview**
This lab introduces students to Core IoT, a platform used for device management, data
visualization, and real-time analytics. By the end of this lab, students will understand how to
connect IoT devices to ThingsBoard, send and receive telemetry data, and create
interactive dashboards for monitoring IoT systems.

**Learning Outcomes**
● Publish telemetry data and visualize it using ThingsBoard dashboards.
● Implement basic rule chains for event-driven automation.
